🙂 Version Control :  
                  Tracking and modifying changes on your project file.  
                  Day 1 - version 1  /  Day 2 - version 2  /  Day 3 - version 3  

😌 Git :        
      It's kind of a local tool for Version Control System and by using git commands we can able to track and manage changes.

USES OF GIT :   
      📍 Track all the changes in files.

In Initial There are imporatant two way terms in Git & GitHub  

1 : Git cloning methods ( pull codes from github to vs )  

git clone "https://github.com/iamHaneef/git-version-control-practice.git"

git add . / git add sorting.java

git commit -m "git_clone done"

git push origin main


---

2 : Git Remote ( push our written code to empty GitHub Repository )

Basically : push our code to github

Create folder in file manager 

git init -> initialize git in that file

Create GitHub repo (empty repo) in git hub

Connect them using: git remote add origin https://github.com/iamHaneef/git-remote.git
