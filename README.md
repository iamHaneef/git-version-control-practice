When Learning Git and GitHub is Confused , but learned in this way was helped me a lot !

🙂 Version Control :  
                  Tracking and modifying changes on your project file.  
                  Day 1 - version 1  /  Day 2 - version 2  /  Day 3 - version 3  

😌 Git :        
      It's kind of a local tool for Version Control System and by using git commands we can able to track and manage changes.

USES OF GIT :   
      📍 Track all the changes in files.  
      📍 Restore old files easily.  
      📍 Store all previous files data or codes.  
      📍 Avoid Confusion.  
      📍 Best on Team collaborative work.  
      

😉 Git Hub :  
     🔗 It's a website or platform which is used to store all git files or project seamlessly.  
     🔗 Easily share all files to team members in github , team members easily able to work on those files , make changes , modifications , updated.

In Initial There are imporatant two way terms in Git & GitHub  

1 : Git cloning methods ( pull codes from github to vs )  

🌟 git clone "https://github.com/iamHaneef/git-version-control-practice.git"

🌟 git add . / git add sorting.java

🌟 git commit -m "git_clone done"

🌟 git push origin main

2 : Git Remote ( push our written code to empty GitHub Repository )

Basically : push our code to github

Create folder in file manager 

🌟 git init -> initialize git in that file

🌟 Create GitHub repo (empty repo) in git hub

Connect them using: 

🌟 git remote add origin https://github.com/iamHaneef/git-remote.git

🌟 git add . / git add sorting.java
